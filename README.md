# Banking-Account-Manager-Using-OOP-Python-
My third project on GitHUb. Just a simple project to test my OOPs skills. This program simulates a simple banking system with OOPs concepts. 
This program can: 
1) Create multiple bank accounts with unique account numbers and passwords.
2) Deposit, withdraw and transfer money from 1 bank account to another.
3) Simulate advancing years by adding in the interest.
4) Uses Classes, Objects, python decorators and data encapsulation.

The purpose of this program is to show my growth in OOPs concepts over the months.
